## Prerequisites

- Docker
- Node.js
- Yarn

## To start development

 - Create `.env` file in root folder
 - Install dependencies
```bash
$ yarn
```
 - Start development server - (default exposed PORT of application is 5000)
```bash
$ docker compose up
```
 - Create a tunnel (using [ngrok](https://ngrok.com)) 
 ```bash
$ ./ngrok http -region=ap $PORT
```
 - change the resource of datasource to be your opening tunnel via [AWS Appsync console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/console/home) 

## How it works

![application overview](./readme/assets/overview.png)

when user send messages to our channel in [LINE](https://line.me/en/) or [Messenger](https://www.messenger.com/) platform. They will forward those events via webhook url. The events are going to be directly through [mac-mantis (aka Messaging)](https://github.com/appman-agm/mac-mantis)  service. It acts as an adaptor for transforming event data of every channels to be in the proper format used inside AOC. Then, the [Messaging]((https://github.com/appman-agm/mac-mantis)) call graphQL mutation `appendNewMessage` and the pipeline is executed (via [Appsync](https://aws.amazon.com/appsync/)) in order to save those messages into DynamoDB and send them to [IR-auto (aka bot)](https://github.com/appman-agm/ir-auto) as well
On the other hand, [Bot](https://github.com/appman-agm/ir-auto) uses the same way in order to respond messages to the users.

## Remarks
IR-auto utilize [XState library](https://xstate.js.org/) (state machine) for controlling the user flow.
Plus, with [Redis](https://redis.io/) for store the individual session of user

here is some example of application flow created by state machine :
